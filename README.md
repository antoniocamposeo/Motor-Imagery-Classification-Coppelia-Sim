# Motor-Imagery-Classification-Coppelia-Sim
## Project for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Exam.
The aim of the project is to be able to classify the thought of moving the right or left hand based on EEG data. These data were taken from the BCI competition IV, in particular dataset 2a and 2b were used. Finally, an application was made in network simulation, which, based on the received EEG signal, classifies it and outputs a signal to turn right or left that will be sent to a steered vehicle in CoppeliaSim.
